# Commodity
*A phone app for low-income families to help find commodities such as water, food, and free events.*

The aim of this project would be to increase opportunity for the local Homeless population and provide low income families the means to get by. The quoted block shows data from this survey done through the University of Southern California.

>"Homeless adults experience increased risk of negative health
outcomes, and technology-based interventions may provide an opportunity for improving health in this population...More than half currently owned a smartphone,and 86% of those used Android operating systems. Most (85%) used a cell phone daily, 76% used text messaging, and 51% accessed the Internet on their cell phone."


 

### The MVP
> Commodity, by the end of the development life cycle, should be able to provide a map with local resources for those in need.  

##### Further Requirements:
- Menu system for finding other resources, such as Hotlines, Specific Services, and items deemed a commodity
- Filter for specific resources
- Provide directions for free events where food, water, materials or simply family activities can be found
- The user will be able to find directions to these resources and find ways to get in contact with the providers. 

### Milestones
- Team should understand the project holistically
- Split teams for Front End and Back End development
- Front End decide on iconography 
- Front End completion of wire frames and tech stack installation
- Back End should be familiarized with Firebase at this point working on account validation
- Ability to search and retrieve data such as free food, water, housing and other resources through the map
- ability to one click access to various hotlines
- Display all sorts of events based on different resources available

### Stretch Goals
- tutorials for the homeless population, i.g how to make a makeshift shelter, etc.
- Partnering with local non-profits
- Navigation ability

### Tech Stack
> the Tech Stack isn't concrete; feel free to do your own research and decide what technologies would be best suited for the app!

##### Here are some ideas:
* [React Native] - component based frame work, prevents boilerplating!
* [Flutter] - Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
* [Firebase] - Integrates easily with both Flutter and React.
* [Android Studio] - You should know why.
* [git] - Pretty terminal. (Here is a [cheat sheet])

### Installation

##### Getting started with React Native:
React Native's documentation describes how to install it perfectly.
Open git or Terminal and run this command:
```sh
> npx react-native init MyTestApp
```
after running, follow the rest of the article to quickly create a mock app: [React Native Installation]
